The Scale Out Computing on AWS (SOCA) installer retrieves a number of third-party software packages (such as open source packages) from third-party servers at install-time or build-time ("External Dependencies").  The External Dependencies are subject to license terms that you must accept in order to use SOCA, including an Affero GPL license.  If you do not accept all of the applicable license terms, you should not use SOCA.  We recommend that you consult your company’s open source approval policy before proceeding.
