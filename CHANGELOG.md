# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/).


## [25.11.0] - 2025-11-17


### Features
- Added support for `Asia Pacific (Taipei)` / `ap-east-2` to SOCA.
  - Not all BaseOSes are supported - check `region_map.d` for more information.
- Introducing smart subnet id selection for Virtual Desktops and Target Nodes provisioning. When enabled, SOCA will validate capacity availability and try other subnets automatically as needed.
- SOCA installation will now create a dedicated cluster SNS topic for important administrative events. The interactive installer now asks for the `E-mail address` for notifications.
- You can now add environment variables during EKS job submission
- Added ability to disable domain join for HPC ephemeral nodes
- Added `--email` command-line option to `soca_install.sh` to provide the notification E-mail address. Format can be `--email email1@example.com --email email2@example.com` or `--email email1@example.com,email2@example.com`.
- Improved VDI Idle detection by using `GPU` as well as `CPU` as a resource for idle detection
  - Supported on `NVIDIA` GPUs only at this release
- Preview support for IBM Spectrum LSF scheduler
- Preview support for SchedMD Slurm scheduler
- Preview support for new SOCA Automatic Host Provisioning (disabled by default)
- Preview support to optionally disable Active Directory domain join for ephemeral HPC compute nodes

### Changed

- Updated `SOCA Controller` default instance type to `m8i-flex.large` in regions where it is available.
- Updated `OpenSearch` default instance to `m7g.large.search` when SOCA is creating the OpenSearch/Analytics cluster.
- Removed support for `AWS Directory Service - Simple AD` as a back-end user Directory (disabled in previous releases).
- Increased the AD Join loop to 30 tries for slower AD environments or faster ephemeral nodes.
- Updated all BaseOS AMIs for all regions/partitions for more up to date AMIs.
- Continue deprecation of `CentOS 7` and removed `CentOS 7`
- Split the creation of `VPC Endpoints` between `interface` and `gateway`

- Updated various Python modules
- Updated AWS EFA Installer to `1.43.2`
- Increased SocaLogger's rotating file size limit from 5MB to 50MB
- PBS Nodes are now registering using their private Ipv4 as MoM  (previous AWS Private DNS, which could cause some problems when using custom non-AWS DNS)
- Updated missing API documentations for `VirtualDesktopProfilesManager`, `TargetNodeSoftwareStacksManager` and `GetVirtualDesktopsSessionState`
- RHEL9 updated from RHEL9.5 to RHEL9.6
- AL2023 updated from `2023.7` to `2023.9` kernel 6.1

### Fixes

- NVIDIA drivers are now installed correctly on Ubuntu `-aws` kernels
- Fixed TargetNode hibernation detection defect (seen during launch).
- Added automatic AZ selection for the `SOCA Controller` based on the selected `Instance Type`. Previously the first AZ in a region was always used but this may change based on AZ-availability of a selected instance type.
- Fixed bug that prevents tags to be propagated correctly when using FSx for Lustre

## [25.8.0] - 2025-08-05

### In Preview

Features in preview can be enabled in `default_config.yml` (or via `socactl` on running environment) via the new Feature Flags framework.
These features are not yet considered stable but are available for experimental use.

- Capacity Reservation support for Virtual Desktops.
- Introducing `SOCA Containers` management via Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS)

### Features

- SOCA Installation using `Existing Resources` can now make use of existing `FSx/OpenZFS` during installation.
  - NOTE - The FSx/OpenZFS filesystem needs to be configured with the `no_root_squash` setting for the `controller` host or globally.
- Updated APIs spec to OpenAPI 3.1. Documentation is now available for Swagger and RapiDoc
- Added support for Fractional GPU instances (`g6f`)

### Changed

- Instance types are now sorted by generation (newest first) and size (largest first)
- Automatically install GPU driver on Windows 2025
- Updated NVIDIA GRID Driver from `18.1` to `18.4` for Linux VDI instances

### Fixes
- A javascript error prevented application profiles from being saved into the database properly. This would manifest as an empty application once it was saved.

## [25.5.0] - 2025-05-13

### Features

- Amazon Linux 2023 can now be used as a Virtual Desktop node
- Updated Python environment from `3.9.21` from `3.13.2`
- You can now decide to configure `virtual` or `console` DCV sessions via the web interface

### Changed

- Updated RHEL9 version from `9.3` to `9.5`
- Updated Amazon Linux 2023 version from `2023.6` to `2023.7`
- Misc `pip` package updates

## [25.3.0] - 2025-03-31

### Features

- New Base OSes supported:
  - `Windows Server 2022` and `Windows Server 2025` for Windows VDI
  - Ubuntu `22.04 LTS` and Ubuntu `24.04 LTS` for Linux VDI and HPC compute nodes
- The SOCA ALB TLS policy can now be controlled in the configuration file (`default_config.yaml`) via `Config.network.alb_tls_policy`.
  - The policy defaults to `ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06` if not specified in the configuration. This allows for `TLS 1.3` and `TLS 1.2` *ONLY*.
  - If you have clients connecting with older versions of TLS / SSL, you will need to update this parameter_
  - For a full list of TLS policy names and associated security protocols/ciphers allowed please consult the AWS Application Load Balancer [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/describe-ssl-policies.html)
- [AWS Global Accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/) is now supported for public-facing deployments
  - AWS Global Accelerator is disabled by default and can be enabled in the `default_config.yaml` by setting `Config.network.aws_aga.enabled` to `true`.

- SOCA Controller logic has been moved to a local partition `/opt/soca` for better performance and security. Boostrap logs are still available on `/apps/soca/`
- SSH access to the Controller host is now limited to SOCA admins
- Virtual Desktop interface has been revamped:
  - Introducing a brand-new web interface 
  - Linux and Windows desktops can now be deployed in the same page
  - You can now edit a software stack
  - Introducing Virtual Desktop Profiles, giving you ability to limit the type of instance, storage, and subnets that can be used for your software stacks
  - SOCA admins can list all active virtual desktops
- Introducing SOCA Projects: a new way to control ACLs for Virtual Desktops
- Added integration to your [Amazon Q Business](https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/) application if specified

### Changed
- Misc HTML cleanups in the SOCA WebUI
- The Amazon Route 53 Resolver Endpoints for the directory service now make use of their own discrete Security Group. This security group allows for the SOCA cluster to interact with the Resolver as well as the VPC IP CIDR Range.

### Fixes
- A jsii Runtime error would be generated if the configuration for login nodes had a `desired_count` that was lower or higher than the `min_count`/`max_count`. This has been corrected.
- A jsii Runtime error would be generated if ElastiCache was disabled due to missing `node.add_dependency()`
- A jsii Runtime error would be generated if Analytics was disabled due to empty Parameter Store value
- The logged in username was missing from the analytics dashboard page. This has been fixed.
- Under certain circumstances the internal Python interpreter for the OpenPBS scheduler can fail to process hooks after an internal restart. This would cause any future hooks to fail until the service was restarted. The default restart interval for the internal Python interpreter has been updated to `9,999,999` jobs to fix this.
- Using the `Private` subnet entry mode during installation would generate an error and cause the installation to fail. This has been fixed. (Introduced in `24.10.0`)


## [25.1.0] - 2025-01-28

### Features

- Introduction of [SOCA Storage AutoMount](https://awslabs.github.io/scale-out-computing-on-aws-documentation/documentation/storage/shared-storage/), a wrapper to simplify filesystems management
- Added support for FSx for NetApp ONTAP for /apps & /data partitions (including ACL and CIFS automatic setup)
- Added support for S3-Mountpoint (Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is a simple, high-throughput file client for mounting an Amazon S3 bucket as a local file system)
- Enabled [SOCA Easy AMI setup](https://awslabs.github.io/scale-out-computing-on-aws-documentation/tutorials/reduce-compute-node-launch-time-with-custom-ami/) 
- Added `file_download` wrapper for [SOCA Node Boostrap customizations](https://awslabs.github.io/scale-out-computing-on-aws-documentation/documentation/architecture/node-bootstrap/customize-node-boostrap/)

### Changed

**_IMPORTANT BASE OS CHANGES_**
-  **NOTE** - This is part of a multi-release deprecation process for older/unsupported BaseOSes
- Continue to wind-down support for `CentOS 7`, `CentOS 8` and `RHEL 7` for new installations
  - You can enable installation to these BaseOSes with custom AMIs by manually adding AMIs to the proper sections in the `installer/region_map.yaml` file
  - Migration should take place ASAP if you are still using these unsupported releases

- Update `region_map.yaml` to include newer AWS regions / AMIs (not all BaseOSes are available in all regions)
- `SOCA_CONFIGURATION` environment variable has been renamed to `SOCA_CLUSTER_ID` to be consistent with `SocaConfig` naming convention
- ERROR/WARNING and FATAL bootstrap log messages are now copied to discrete log files in addition to standard stdout log
- Reworked Linux System Packages template to simplify support for current and future operating systems
- Simplified `default_config.yml` syntax by removing un-necessary keys
- Adding `orchestrator` and `analytics` folder to the S3 logs backup mechanism
- Boto3 / botocore updated to `1.36.2`
- Python updated from `3.9.19` to `3.9.21`
- OpenMPI updated from `5.0.5` to `5.0.6`
- AWS EFA installer updated from `1.34.0` to `1.38.0`
- Added `m7i.large` and `m6i.large` as default instance types for consideration during installations
- Default to `TLS1.2` policy for OpenSearch deployments for better security and compatibility
- Default to `OpenSearch 2.17` engine for new installations where SOCA creates the OpenSearch cluster
- Update `OpenPBS` installation method to install from a specific GitHub `commitid` versus a specific release
  - This allows several defect fixes/updates since the most recent release of `OpenPBS`
  - This can be adjusted in the `default_config.yaml` to restore the previous behavior (**NOTE:** May contain defects that are already fixed!)
- Removed redundant/retired Lambdas (`ResetDSPassword`, `GetESPrivateIPLambda`) and associated resources as the functionality has been updated/replaced

### Fixes

- Improve the experience during installation to regions with limited instance type options.
- Various smaller fixes (typos, linting, etc)
- CloudFormation outputs now returns the correct VPC Endpoint for OpenSearch

### Known Issues

- Some BaseOS combinations may not work in all situations (Controller BaseOS, Compute Node, VDI, etc.) or features due to the age of the BaseOS. BaseOSes that are past their End of Life (EOL) support dates from the supplier may be removed in a future SOCA version.
- If you select differing architectures (e.g. `x86_64` and `arm64` for the instance_types in the cluster - the cluster will fail). This will be addressed in a future release.
- Linux VDI/DCV instances default to `Amazon Linux 2` - not the installed BaseOS of the cluster.
- Creating a VDI session with an unsupported name will filter-out the unsupported characters - potentially causing conflict with the CloudFormation stackname.
- Under rapid changes - the WebUI file browser may show incorrect results
- The default deployment makes use of synthetic POSIX `uid` and `gid` generated for linux instances via `sssd`. This is not compatible in all scenarios.
- Current Windows VDI images default to `40GB` root disks, and have approx `15GB` free after startup. This may not be enough for some larger installation packages. A larger default is expected in a future SOCA release.
- Windows VDI/DCV launches will fail in CloudFormation when using `ED25519` Key Pairs. This is not a SOCA restriction/defect. A future SOCA version will detect this and not allow the attempted launch.



## [24.10.0] - 2024-10-24

### Forward

Hello and welcome to the `24.10.0` release of SOCA!  Please note the new version format is based on `CalVer` style versions.

Due to the amount of changes that have taken place we want to provide a bit more narrative on some of these changes versus a classic ChangeLog.

This release contains numerous improvements and fixes. We anticipate it being applicable to many more situations and being our best release yet!

Some areas of improvement with this release include:

* Improved Security
  * More specific IAM policy for restricted environments
  * SSH keys are now generated for `RSA` and `ED25519` key types automatically for new users (Support for `DSA` and `ECDSA` is being removed in general industry-wide in early 2025)

  * Discrete Security Groups providing fine-grained access control adjustments for more resources
    * Elastic Load Balancers, Compute Nodes, Controller Host, Login Nodes, VPC-Endpoints all now get discrete Security Groups.

  * Improved AWS Key Management Service (KMS) integration for specifying Customer Managed Keys (CMK)
    * Each resource now supports discrete KMS KeyIDs or a cluster-wide KeyID can be specified for ease of deployment

  * Improved behavior during installation into AWS Accounts with Service control policies (SCPs) or CDK restrictions
    * New options are exposed in the `soca_installer.sh` to pass CDK Execution roles which can be provisioned ahead of time

* Rewrite of several key areas for better debugging and readability
  * Improvements to installation logging/debugging as well as cluster runtime debugging

* Migration of the bulk of SOCA configuration settings from `AWS Secrets Manager` to `AWS System Manager Parameter Store`.
  * This now makes editing individual configuration settings more intuitive.
  * Don't worry - Secrets Manager is still used for sensitive configuration items!

* Version upgrades to keep up with current external package advancements

* Deprecation of self-hosted OpenLDAP in favor of using `AWS Directory Service` or `External Directories`.
  * This is an important step to refreshing and streamlining our BaseOS support in future versions as it decouples the BaseOS from the availability of an OpenLDAP-server package
  * Expect this to provide newer BaseOS support in the future

* Improved logic for handling newer instance types as soon as they are available (`zero-day instance support`)
  * This is critical for supporting newer instances without the need to upgrade any SOCA cluster components

* Reduction of running costs of the SOCA cluster
  * Support for `Amazon ElastiCache Serverless` (replaces `Redis` running on the `controller` directly) 
  * Ability to disable `analytics` engine to remove the need for OpenSearch


* Improved use of `existing_resources` - Better resource polling during installation time to help identify the resources for use in SOCA.
  * The following resources can be used as `existing_resources` during a SOCA installation:
    * VPCs, Subnets, Filesystems (EFS, FSx), Security Groups, Directory Services, IAM Roles

As always we value your feedback - please do not hesitate to leave a GitHub issue/discussion if you are having any specific problems or want to discuss the future of SOCA.


Thank you,

- The SOCA Team

And now - back to your normal ChangeLog :)


### Features
- Updated SOCA versioning to [CalVer](https://calver.org/) format.
- SOCA now automatically create a default admin user `socaadmin` with a secure password stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- Added support for `SSH Login Nodes`. Login Nodes are SSH endpoints managed by AutoScaling running on Private Subnets and accessible via a newly introduced Network Load Balancer. Network Load Balancer can be deployed either in public or private subnets.
- Added `socactl` CLI utility as an interface for SOCA configuration. You can now update your entire SOCA environment with a simple command.
- Migrated SOCA Configuration to AWS System Manager Parameter Store
- Remove support for `ElasticSearch`. `Amazon OpenSearch` is now the only option for the analytics back-end.
- Migrated `cluster_node_boostrap` shell/powershell scripts to full Jinja2 support
- Enable debug log for web interface, orchestrator ... via `export SOCA_DEBUG=1`
- Added support for `ldaps://` (default) in addition of `ldap://` when using OpenLDAP
- Added support for `AWS Directory Service Simple Active Directory` in addition of `AWS Directory Service Managed AD`
- Added native support for existing `OpenLDAP` or existing `Active Directory` directory service
- OpenPBS / Workload scheduler can now be installed from `git` or `s3 URI`
- OpenSearch / Analytics is now optional
- Initial support added for `AWS Backup logically air-gapped vaults` via the `additional_copy_destinations` in the `default_config.yml` configuration file. This allows for increased protection of critical backups. See [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/building-cyber-resiliency-with-aws-backup-logically-air-gapped-vault/) for information on `Logically Air-gapped Vaults`. Additional configuration information can be found in the `default_config.yml` `backup` configuration section. 
- Added new `utils` class to help you customize your SOCA environment:
  - `SocaCacheClient`: Cache wrapper (currently only support Redis/ValKey on Amazon ElastiCache)
  - `SocaCastEngine`: Easily cast variables to requested type
  - `SocaConfig`: Wrapper for SOCA Configuration on Parameter Store
  - `SocaError`: Database for all errors returned by SOCA
  - `SocaIdentityProviderClient`: Wrapper for OpenLDAP or Active Directory
  - `SocaHttpClient`: HTTP client for all SOCA internal endpoints
  - `SocaLogger`: Centralized Logging framework
  - `SocaSubprocessClient`: Wrapper to execute shell commands on SOCA
  - `SocaReponse`: Wrapper for CLI/HTTP response that can be invoked in a CLI or web context
  - `SocaJinja2Generator`: Wrapper for Jinja2 template generation
  - `SocaAnalyticsClient`: Wrapper for OpenSearch

### Changed
- `Scheduler` has been replaced with `Controller` to better indicate the role in the SOCA environment. Some areas may still refer to this as `Scheduler` as this gets updated over time. 
- `Login Node` has been introduced to provide CLI access for end-users (they are no longer expected to log in to the scheduler/controller directly)
- `Controller` host has been automatically moved to Private Subnets
- `Controller` host instance type has been updated to `m7i-flex.large` from `m5.large`
- Configurations in `default_config.yml` that takes `instance_type` now take a list of instances. These will be determined at deployment time based on the order of preference (first match wins).
- Make use of `Amazon ElastiCache Serverless` instead of downloading/compiling Redis directly on the Scheduler/Controller
- Updated OpenSearch default version to `2.15`
- Updated Node.js on Controller Host to v`20.9.0` where applicable (some older BaseOSes may run older/compatible versions)
- Updated AWS EFA installer from `1.31.0` to `1.34.0`
- Updated OpenMPI from `5.0.2` to `5.0.5`
- Updated `monaco-editor` from `0.46.0` to `0.52.0`
- Consolidated `cluster_manager` file folder hierarchy
- Moved the SOCA AMI Map (aka the `Region Map`) to a dedicated file `region_map.yml` from the `default_config.yml`. Custom Base AMIs can be updated here.
- The SOCA CLI installer will now check/enforce that an existing VPC has the attributes`DNS hostnames` and `DNS resolution` enabled. Non-compliant VPCs will show an error indicating the missing attribute and will not be selectable. 
- When adding a new user - SSH keys are now generated for `RSA` and `ED25519` key types. Note the deprecation of `DSA` and `ECDSA` has been taking place for nearly a decade and will soon be unavailable in OpenSSH.
- The configuration element `DCVAllowedInstances` did not default to the entries from `default_config.yml`. This has been fixed.


### Known Issues

- Some BaseOS combinations may not work in all situations (Controller BaseOS, Compute Node, VDI, etc.) or features due to the age of the BaseOS. BaseOSes that are past their End of Life (EOL) support dates from the supplier may be removed in a future SOCA version.
- If you select differing architectures (e.g. `x86_64` and `arm64` for the instance_types in the cluster - the cluster will fail). This will be addressed in a future release.
- Linux VDI/DCV instances default to `Amazon Linux 2` - not the installed BaseOS of the cluster.
- Creating a VDI session with an unsupported name will filter-out the unsupported characters - potentially causing conflict with the CloudFormation stackname.
- Under rapid changes - the WebUI file browser may show incorrect results
- The default deployment makes use of synthetic POSIX `uid` and `gid` generated for linux instances via `sssd`. This is not compatible in all scenarios.
- Current Windows VDI images default to `40GB` root disks, and have approx `15GB` free after startup. This may not be enough for some larger installation packages. A larger default is expected in a future SOCA release.
- Windows VDI/DCV launches will fail in CloudFormation when using `ED25519` Key Pairs. This is not a SOCA restriction/defect. A future SOCA version will detect this and not allow the attempted launch.


## [2.7.5] - 2024-04-10

### Features
- Support for [Amazon Linux 2023](https://aws.amazon.com/linux/amazon-linux-2023/) as a BaseOS for compute nodes
  - eVDI on Amazon Linux 2023 is not currently supported
- Support for `5 new AWS Regions`: `ap-northeast-3`, `ap-southeast-4`, `eu-central-2`, `eu-south-2`, and  `il-central-1`. 
  - Note that not all Base OSes are available in All regions
- Support for `RHEL8`, `RHEL9`, `Rocky8`, and `Rocky9` operating systems for both DCV and compute nodes
- Support for newer AWS Instance types/families. This includes `hpc7a`, `hpc7g`, `r7iz`, `g6`, `gr6`, `g5`, `g5g`, `c7i`, `p5`, and many more (where supported in the region)
- Support for [AWS GovCloud](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/) Partition installation by default
  - Include AMIs for regions `us-gov-west-1` and `us-gov-east-1`
  - Note that not all Base OSes are available in All regions within GovCloud
  - Set environment variable `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to a GovCloud region prior to invoking `soca_installer.sh`
- Improve compatibility and support SOCA deployments on `AWS Outposts` (compute, eVDI)
  - The default `VolumeType` in Secrets Manager needs to be configured to reflect the AWS Outposts `gp2` support
- Support has been added for multi-interface EFA instances such as the `p5.48xlarge`. For compute instances that support multiple EFA interfaces - all EFA interfaces will be created during provisioning.
- The SOCA Administrator can now define the list of approved eVDI instances via new configuration parameters:
  - `DCVAllowedInstances` - A list of patterns for allowed instance names. For example `["m7i-flex.*", "m7i.*", "m6i.*", "m5.*", "g6.*", "gr6.*", "g5.*", "g5g.*", "g4dn.*", "g4ad.*"]`
  - (Optional) `DCVAllowBareMetal` (defaults to `False`) - Allow listing of Bare Metal instances for eVDI
  - (Optional) `DCVAllowPreviousGenerations` (defaults to `False`) - Allow listing of previous generation(s) of instances for eVDI

### Changed
- Improved user experience using `soca_installer.sh` in high-density VPC/subnet environments
- Improved the log message for an Invalid `subnet_id` during job submission to include the specific `subnet_id` that triggered the error
- Updated Python from `3.9.16` to `3.9.18`
- Updated AWS Boto3/botocore from `1.26.91` to `1.34.71`
- Updated OpenMPI from `4.1.5` to `5.0.2`
- Updated OpenPBS from `22.05.11` to `23.06.06`
- Updated Monaco-Editor from `0.36.1` to `0.46.0`
- Updated AWS EFA installer from `1.22.1` to `1.31.0`
- Updated NICE DCV from `2023.0-14852` to `2023.1-16388` (except for RHEL7 and CentOS7)
- Update NVM from `0.39.3` to `0.39.7`
- Updated Node from `16.15.0` to `16.20.2`
- Updated Lambda Runtimes to Python `3.11` where applicable
- Misc Python 3rd party module version updates
- Refactor installation items for newer AWS CDK methods
- Updated default `OpenSearch` engine version to `2.11` when creating an OpenSearch deployment
- The use of `add_nodes.py` to add `AlwaysOn` nodes now allows the parameter `--instance_ami` to be optional and will default to the `CustomAMI` in the cluster configuration
- Download/install/configure `Redis` version `7.2.4` for new SOCA cache backend
- The SOCA ELB/ALB is now created with the option `drop_invalid_headers` set to `True` by default.
- Several UWSGI application server adjustments
  - Activate UWSGI `stats` server on `127.0.0.1:9191`
  - Activate UWSGI `offload-threads`
  - Activate UWSGI `threaded-logger`
  - Activate UWSGI `memory-report`
  - Activate UWSGI `microsecond logging`
  - Activate UWSGI logging of the `X-Forwarded-For` headers so that the client IP address is captured versus the ELB IP Address
  - Added `uwsgitop` to assist in UWSGI performance investigations. This can be accessed via the command `uwsgitop localhost:9191` from the scheduler.
  - Adjusted Flask session backend from `SQLite` to `redis`. This results in a much faster WebUI/session handling.
  - **NOTE** - Upgrade scenarios should take UWSGI changes into account and manually perform Redis installation/configuration and session migration.
- `Launch Tenancy` and `Launch Host` have been added as options when registering an AMI in SOCA. These will be used during DCV session creation.
  - For more information on launch tenancy - see the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html).
- Updated default OpenSearch instance from `m5.large.search` to `m6g.large.search`
- Updated default VDI choices from `m5` to `m6i` instance family
- `instance_ami` is no longer mandatory when specifying a custom `base_os`. SOCA will determine which default AMI to use automatically via the `CustomAMIMap` configuration stored on Secrets Manager.  
- Changed default `instance_type` for all base HPC queues from `c5` to `c6i` instance family
- Updated DCV Session default `Storage Size` to `40GB` to accommodate additional locally installed software such as GPU drivers, libs, etc.

### Fixes
- `DryRun` job submission was not taking into account the `IMDS` settings for the cluster. This could cause job submission to fail `DryRun` and not be submitted.
- Installation using an existing `OpenSearch` / `ElasticSearch` domain was not working as expected. This has been fixed.
- Avoid sending `CpuOptions` with `hpc7a`, `hpc7g`, `g5`, `g5g` instances. This will fix launching on these instance families.
- Properly detect newer AWS metal instances for determining if `CpuOptions` is supported during instance launch. This will allow launching `c7i.metal-24xl`, `c7i.metal-48xl` (and others) to function properly
- On the `scheduler` Post-Install - extract/compile `OpenMPI` on a local EBS volume instead of EFS (can reduce compile time by `50%+`)
- During HPC Job submission within the WebUI - the multi-select UI element `Checkbox Group` was not passed correctly to the underlying job scripting
  - `Checkbox Group` element values will be delimited by comma by default (e.g. `option1,option2`).
  - Care should be taken to not have option values contain the delimiter character. This can be updated in `submit_job.py` as needed. (Option name fields can contain the delimiter character)
- During DCV Session creation - the user was allowed to enter a session name that exceeded the allowable length for a CloudFormation stack name. This has been adjusted to trim the session name to appropriate length (32 characters).
- During DCV Session creation - if the session contained an underscore (_) the session would produce an error and not be created.
- During DCV Session creation - The `Storage Size` was allowed to be lower than a stored AMI. This will now default / auto-size to the AMI specification.
- Bootstrap tooltips are now displayed using the correct CSS in the Remote Desktop pages
- Previously during invocation of `soca_installer.sh` with existing resources - only VPCs and Subnets with AWS `Name` tags would be selectable. This restriction has been eased to allow resources without `Name` tags to be selectable.
- Under certain conditions in an Active Directory (AD) environment - the `scheduler` computer object could be mistakenly replaced in AD by an incoming compute or VDI node. This was due to NetBIOS name length restrictions causing name conflicts. This has been corrected.

### Known Caveats
- Web Sessions can be stored in the back-end (redis) that relate to API calls or other situations where return of the session is not expected. These sessions will be cleaned up automatically by Redis when the TTL expires (24hours).
- On the Remote Desktop selection for Instance Types - sorting, grouping, and custom names of the AWS instances is not configurable by the SOCA Administrator for wildcard instances allowed via wildcard (e.g. `g5.*`).
  - This can cause 'selection fatigue' for end-users when a large number of instances types are allowed.
  - The SOCA Administrator can configure the static list at the top before the generated list appears. See the `cluster_web_ui/templates/remote_desktop.html` (Linux) and `cluster_web_ui/templates/remote_desktop_windows.html` (Windows) files for examples/defaults.
  - The SOCA Administrator can reduce the default instances allowed by editing the AWS Secrets Manager configuration entry for the cluster and refreshing the configuration on the cluster.
